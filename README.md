# Visual-Odometry
Visual Odometry is a crucial concept in Robotics Perception for estimating the trajectory of the robot (the camera on the robot to be precise). The concepts involved in Visual Odometry are quite the same for SLAM which needless to say is an integral part of Perception.

## Overview
In this project, for given frames of a driving sequence taken by a camera in a car, we estimated the 3D motion of the camera and provide as output a plot of the trajectory of the camera.
